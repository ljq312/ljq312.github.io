### Projects
***
##### Biostatistical Methods
*	Identified variables associated with hospital length of stay (LoS) patterns to construct a predictive model using Multiple Linear Regression with R and SAS.
*	Ran rigorous model diagnostics (check influential point, collinearity, interaction, etc.) and model validation (Cross-Validation, bootstrap).
* Report is available [here](Downloads/BMI_Final_Project_Report.pdf), and repo is available [here](https://github.com/ljq312/BMI_FinalProject)

    
##### Data Science - *Flight Delay Patterns*
*	Explored factors associated with flight delay patterns from 2012 through 2016 using R.
*	Manipulated 2.8GB of data, and analyzed 30 million flights.
*	Created a [Github website](https://tuyuqi.github.io/delay_flight_website/index.html) to display project findings, including a [report](https://tuyuqi.github.io/delay_flight_website/flight_delay.html), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smI6NE5xw4Y), and interactive data visuals made by Plotly and ggplot.

### Homeworks
***
##### Data Science - *Shiny Dashboard with NYC restaurant inspection data*
* **Shiny Dashboard with NYC restaurant inspection data: ** Created a interactable [shiny dashboard](https://ljq312.shinyapps.io/p8105_hw6_jl5025_problem2/) to visualize the NYC restaurant grade and violation description based on boro and cuisine type. 

##### Statistical Learning 
* **Linear Regression & Nonlinear Regression: ** Fitting Linear Regression using least squares, ridge, lasso,and partial least squares. Fitting Nonlinear Regression using spline and generalized additive model. Report is availabe [here](Downloads/hw1.html)
* **Classification: **Classify market returns (positive or negative) for the S&P 500 stock index using Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and K-Nearest-Neighbor classifier. Report is available [here](Downloads/hw2.html)
